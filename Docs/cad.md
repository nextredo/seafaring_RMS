## Gimbal Camera Mount

### Part Description

- This part connects the gimbal camera mount plate to the camera

### Features and Considerations

- Spot for camera wires
  - Wire netting (not part of CAD)
- Heatsink / airflow area (ventilation)
- Printability (no complex / floating geometry)
- Flexibility of final design

### Designs

- Sandwiches
  - With nuts and bolts
  - With angled plates attached to the cam rail separately
- Lens barrel clip
  - Screws to lens holder, clips to PCB or black plastic at the back
- Screws through PCB and black plastic
  - Simple, efficient, me like
  - Need M2 or M1.5 screws or M2.5????
