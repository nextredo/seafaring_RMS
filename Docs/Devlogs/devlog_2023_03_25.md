## Notes

- Resuming work on camera gimbal mount design

## Camera Model

- Using components from the `.STEP` file of [this ArduCam IMX291 board](https://www.arducam.com/product/arducam-1080p-low-light-wdr-usb-camera-module-for-computer-2mp-1-2-8-cmos-imx291-100-degree-wide-angle-mini-uvc-spy-webcam-board-with-microphone-3-3ft-1m-cable-for-windows-linux-mac-os/)
- Making modifications so it better models my actual camera
  - Turns out `.STEP` files aren't as easy to use as I thought
  - Will model based off physical model and the B2000 ArduCam design
- Model is an assembly. Will become a subassembly of the final mount design.
