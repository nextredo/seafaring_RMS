## Notes

- Worked on the `gcm` v3
  - See [the previous devlog](./devlog_2023_04_06.md#gcm-v3-improvements) for details
- Finished `gcm` v3
- Printed and mounted `gcm` v3

## Large CAD refactor

- Turns out I had inserted the camera backwards in the Solidworks assembly
- Needed to rebuild the entire gcm tabs after flipping the camera around

## `gcm` v4 improvements

Likely not warranted, however, might be useful / needed as an incremental improvement if the gimbal is deemed too shaky due to the camera facing downwards because of poor centre of gravity balance on the `gcm` v3.

- Place another counterweight slot sticking out behind the camera
  - Such that you can insert a coin parallel with the camera PCB
  - Such that camera points upward when powered off, not facing down

## Gimbal Issues

- Of course, I went to test the new camera mount with the gimbal and the IMU isn't connecting
  - The gimbal reads flat values for the accelerometer in the data display

### Troubleshooting

- Wires all connected properly

### Solution

- Steps:
  - Unplugged IMU
  - Powered gimbal on for a bit
  - Powered gimbal off
  - Plugged IMU back in
  - Turned gimbal on
  - Works???????

## TODO

- [ ] thing
