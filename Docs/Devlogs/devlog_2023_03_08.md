## Notes

- It's been far too long since I worked on this
  - I had somewhat planned to do more on this over the uni break, however, life got in the way
- Beginning software setup ((again))

### Subnote 1 (Installation Folder)

- All scripts must be run from the source/RMS folder
- Other places won't work

### Subnote 2 (Consideration)

- How do I make changes to the code?
  - Do I need to recompile?
  - Do I have to have a repo somewhere?

## Software

### **Current Plan**

- Attempt installing RMS into the `conda` environment
  - ***Using [these](https://github.com/CroatianMeteorNetwork/RMS#setting-up) instructions***
- If that fails:
  - Reinstall Ubuntu 22.04 LTS on Borealis
  - Setup VSCode, Oh My ZSH, Git and GCM
  - Install RMS from the [instructions](https://globalmeteornetwork.org/wiki/index.php?title=Installation_for_Linux) VERBATIM

### [Installing on Conda Linux](https://github.com/CroatianMeteorNetwork/RMS#setting-up)

- Instructions from the `readme` on the CMN GitHub page

## TODO

- [ ] thing
