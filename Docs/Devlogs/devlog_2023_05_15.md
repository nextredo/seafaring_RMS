## Notes

- Attempting to fix the [segfault issues in the latest test](../../Tests/stock_RMS/stock_RMS_test_take_3.md)
- Rebased `seafaring_dev` off master
  - In retrospect, probably should've merged master into it instead
  - Would've avoid "rewriting history" so-to-speak
  - Either way - worked

## Creating a Plate Parameters (`.platepar`) File

Following the guide by Mark McIntyre - [linked here](https://github.com/markmac99/ukmon-pitools/wiki/How-to-create-a-Platepar-File)
