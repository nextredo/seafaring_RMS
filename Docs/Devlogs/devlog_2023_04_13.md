## Notes

- I think `CMD_SETYAW` only works from -90 to +90 degrees
  - After further research it's because this command sets the yaw with limited values
  - See the link below and the [RC Inputs Settings subsection](./devlog_2023_04_13.md#rc-inputs-settings)
- Found [an extremely important wiki link](http://www.olliw.eu/storm32bgc-wiki/Inputs_and_Functions#Rc_Input_Processing)

## Further notes

- Added images to devlogs (retroactively from camera roll)
  - Striped EXIF data with `exiftool ./* -all=`
  - Added images [photos folder](./images/photos/)
  - Put in devlogs
  - Audit before push
