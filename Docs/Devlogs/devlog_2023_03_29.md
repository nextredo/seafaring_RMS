## Gimbal

- Issues with gimbal are listed as follows:

```text
- Slow levelling
- Yaw incorrect
- Occasionally doesn't turn on at all
- Yaw sometimes acts as an acceleration rather than absolute angle in data display
```

### o323BGCTool

- Motor control in the "setup" tab
- PID tuning in the PID tab
  - Followed this guide: [Tuning Recipe on the BGC Wiki](http://www.olliw.eu/storm32bgc-wiki/Tuning_Recipe)
- Great success

## GPS Module

- Setting up GPS module for use with the RMS station.

## TODO

- [ ] Put gimbal config files on repo
- [ ] Gimbal tuning markdown
- [X] PID tune the gimbal
  - Needs to vaguely match ship operating conditions
    - Using a dummy load
  - Just so it doesn't freak out too much
  - PID links
