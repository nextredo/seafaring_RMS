## Notes

- Printing `gcm` revision 2
  - For changes as vs v1 see [this devlog subsection](./devlog_2023_04_05.md#print-results)

### `gcm` v3 improvements

- [x] Move two front screw holes closer together (so they're not in front of the other cam pcb screw holes)
- [x] Enlarge base plate screw holes ever so slightly
- [x] Widen camera base
- [x] Spot for counterweight
  - On outside of gimbal (furthest from pitch motor)
  - Ziptie spots for it
  - So camera sits level with the gimbal powered off
    - Allows for less motor strain, easier levelling in relatively calm environments (like those at sea / on land)
  - Possibly as a separate piece to mount on the bottom of the gimbal
    - Or as an extension for the right side of the camera
    - Just a separate block with ziptie holes
    - Or maybe just a separate block with a super hard infill
    - Pyrite weighs 42g
  - Weights
    - Coins?
- [ ] Camera wire guards
  - To deflect the camera wires downward
  - I could probably just do this with heatshrink

## TODO

- [ ] Shorten cable netting on cam for better flexibility
