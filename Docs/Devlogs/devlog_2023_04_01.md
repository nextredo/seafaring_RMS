## GPS

### Sat lock

- Still having issues with reception and satellite lock
- Seems to be ok when I touch the antenna (occasionally)
  - Jumps to 16 sats after touching the antenna (for the first time in a while)
  - If I keep holding it, it loses the sats

#### Solutions

- New module
- New antenna
- Augment existing antenna?
- Try outside in away from the city?
