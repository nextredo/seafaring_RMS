## Camera power issue

Camera breakout cable not outputting 12v while barrel is plugged in

### Checks

- [x] Barrel outputs `12.17v`
- [x] Cable has continuity between barrel input and board connector output (`+` and `gnd`)
- [x] No short between `+` and `gnd` in cable
- [x] Adapter doesn't change coil whine when plugged in vs not

### Issue located

- Problem is the barrel connection
  - Flexing the connection changes whether the `12.17v` shows up on the end plug
  - Need a better barrel connection

### Issue rectified

- Expanded centre pin with a knife
- Makes appropriate electrical contact now

## Further notes

- Performed Camera Siemens star testing
- Made a camera text box
- Further report stuff
