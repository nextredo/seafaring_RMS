## Notes

### CSS and Markdown Styling

- Removed CSS from [Pipeline testing document](../../Tests/stock_RMS/video_pipelines/may_5_2023_pipeline_testing.md)
  - Because GitHub sanitises and doesn't display `<style>`, `<script>` and inline styling in Markdown docs
  - So no CSS for nice formatting `:(`
- [This cool article](https://pragmaticpineapple.com/adding-custom-html-and-css-to-github-readme/) exists to help style Markdown on GitHub anyways
  - Stores styling in an SVG embedded in the Markdown - instead of directly in the markdown
  - Some animations are lost but performs much better than no CSS
- An alternative to bypassing it would be to host code elsewhere (on a site that does allow CSS and HTML in Markdown)
  - Or simply setup a proper wiki for the project

### Documentation Audit

- Repository docs needed some cleaning
- Made [this document](../../Docs/readme.md) on the locations and functions of all Markdown docs in the repo
  - Serves to help navigate the documentation
  - As a patch fix, instead of creating a whole wiki for the project

## RMS Trial Run

- Trial run of a 2hr capture
- More details in this [**preliminary static test document**](../../Tests/stock_RMS/stock_RMS_test_take_2.md)
- Note that:
  - I'd previously used this test document before
  - Intended to setup a test, didn't work
  - Will overwrite old test data and replace with tonight's test

## Final Notes

- Changed USB cable connected to gimbal
  - As I broke the windup mechanism on the other one

## TODO

- [ ] thing
