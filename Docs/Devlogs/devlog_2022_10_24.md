# Notes
- Started work on getting the Pi setup with the regular RMS codebase
- Confirmed to work on Ubuntu 22.04 as detailed by the "Installation for Linux" page on the GMN wiki (resource #1)

# Camera check
- Set IPv4 connection up like Windows
  - Setup just like the network adapter in the cam setup vid

## VLC usage
- After camera has been setup like in the GMN camera setup video
- Use the following URL to get the RTSP feed in VLC
  - `rtsp://192.168.42.10/user=admin&password=&channel=1&stream=0.sdp?real_stream`
  - Stolen from [this link](https://www.aliexpress.com/i/32625248660.html) - obtained by searching `IMX291 RTSP link`

## gstreamer usage
- See [this link](http://wiki.openipc.org/en/notes-for-resorting.html)
  - Same chipset as the camera I have `Hi3516CV300 + IMX291`

# OS config
- Process is documented in `software_setup.md`
  - OS config
  - System utils installation
  - Python config
  - OpenCV config
  - RMS setup
# Resources
1. [Linux install wiki guide](https://globalmeteornetwork.org/wiki/index.php?title=Installation_for_Linux)
2. [RPi4 and general Linux setup guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19ImeNqBTD1ml2iisp5y7CjDrRV33wBeF9rtx3mIVjh4/edit) **this is the important document**

## General Config
- Set timezone to `UTC`

## Results
- Didn't work, will try again later
- Couldn't build OpenCV
  - Using the script `opencv4_install.sh` or the method outlined in resource #2
- pyfits wouldn't install

# Todo
- [ ] Install virtualenv and setup a virtualenv
- [ ] Deactivate conda in `~/.zshrc`
- [ ] Do everything from resource 2 verbatim
- [ ] Fix install documents for this
- [ ] Commits
- [ ] Figure out why pyfits won't install
