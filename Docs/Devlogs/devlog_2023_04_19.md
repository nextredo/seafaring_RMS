## GPS Notes

### Updated Testing Capability

- Updates made
  - Program continuously captures until `SIGINT` issued (at which point it exits gracefully)
  - [`tqdm`](https://github.com/tqdm/tqdm) for nice progress bar indicator
- Reasoning
  - In future, I plan to collect sample data (GPS, gimbal IMU and footage)
  - Such that I can re-use the data later
  - Allows me to
    - Test on known good data
    - Test without needing the sensors plugged in
    - Test more frequently

### [PyGPSClient](https://github.com/semuconsulting/PyGPSClient)

#### [Installation](https://github.com/semuconsulting/PyGPSClient#installation)

```bash
conda create -n gps_gui
conda activate gps_gui
conda install python
pip install tk pillow
pip install --upgrade pygpsclient
pygpsclient
```

#### PyGPSClient Notes

- **Important features**
  - Able to visualise GPS data while logging it to a file
  - Able to replay `NMEA` data from a file post-capture
- Essentially a Linux-compatible version of the u-blox u-center
- Could be useful in future for:
  - Use of GUI components in a RMS dashboard

## `Stormfront`

- Using modified code from [the STorM32 C library](https://github.com/olliw42/storm32bgc/blob/master/c-library/STorM32_lib.h)
- Added extra reference values for [`cmd_reference.py`](../../Tests/gimbal/stormfront/cmd_reference.py)
